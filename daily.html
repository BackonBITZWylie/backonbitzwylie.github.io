                    The things that I'm thankful for are:
                    <p>1. My loving family, mainly my dad who, in spite of what he's going through, continues to support me; and my uncle who gave us a place to live. I love you both! 💖</p>
                    <p>2. My friends who, no matter what I'm going through, support me and take care of me. Thank y'all so much for everything y'all do for me!</p>
                    <p>3. Food, water, and a place to live; which not a lot of people get to have, so I'm thankful for that.</p>

        <p><h1>You decided to go to sleep.</p> You move your math book to the side and lay your head down. You must have dozed off and was snoring loudly, because the next thing you knew your teacher, Mr. Smithe, shook your desk and you fell out of your seat. He said to you, "Why are you sleeping in my class young man?" You had to answer him fast, and right, otherwise you would get sent to the pricipal's office, and then you'd get in trouble by your parents. What do you say?</h1>

        <p><h1>You decided to pull the fire alarm.</p>You raise your hand and say to your teacher, Mr Smithe, "Sir, can I use the restroom please?" He lookes at you, "Just take a pass, and don't take too long, we've got a bunch of stuff to cover." <p>You take a pass and walk out of the classroom. Phase one done. You have to now find a fire alarm far enough away from Mr. Smithe's class and the bathroom, so they don't think it's you who did it. You have two options. Left or right, which do you choose?</p></h1>
        <p><a href="./left.html">Go left.</a></p>
        <p><a href="./right.html">Go right.</a></p>
